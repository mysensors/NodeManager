# MySensors NodeManager [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mysensors/NodeManager.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/mysensors/NodeManager)

NodeManager is intended to take care on your behalf of all those common tasks that a MySensors node has to accomplish, speeding up the development cycle of your projects. 
Consider it as a sort of frontend for your MySensors projects. When you need to add a sensor (which requires just uncommeting a single line),
NodeManager will take care of importing the required library, presenting the sensor to the gateway/controller, executing periodically the main function of the sensor 
(e.g. measure a temperature, detect a motion, etc.), allowing you to interact with the sensor and even configuring it remotely.

## Features

* Allows managing automatically the complexity behind battery-powered sensors spending most of their time sleeping
* Provides common functionalities to read and report the battery level
* For the most common sensors, provide embedded code so to allow their configuration with a single line
* Manage all the aspects of a sleeping cycle by leveraging smart sleep
* Allow configuring the node and any attached sensors remotely
* Allow waking up a sleeping node remotely at the end of a sleeping cycle
* Allow powering on each connected sensor only while the node is awake to save battery
* Report battery level periodically and automatically or on demand
* Calculate battery level without requiring an additional pin and the resistors
* Report signal level periodically and automatically or on demand
* Allow collecting and averaging multiple samples, tracking the last value and forcing periodic updates for any sensor
* Provide built-in capabilities to handle interrupt-based sensors 

## Installation

* Download the package or clone the git repository from https://github.com/mysensors/NodeManager
* Install NodeManager as an additional Arduino library (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)
* Open and customize one of the examples provided with the IDE or open the Template sketch which includes all the built-in sensors commented out
* Add your sensors, configure them and upload the sketch to your arduino board

### Installing the dependencies

Some of the sensors and buik-in capabilities rely on third party libraries. Those libraries are not included within NodeManager and have to be installed from the Arduino IDE Library Manager (Sketch -> Include Library -> Manager Libraries) or manually. 
You need to install the library ONLY if you are planning to enable to use the sensor.

### Upgrade

* Make a backup copy of the library, remove it, download the latest version of NodeManager and install the new library
* Review the release notes in case there is any manual change required to the main sketch

Please be aware when upgrading to v1.8 from an older version this procedure is not supported and the code should be migrated manually.

## Configuration

Configuring a sketch with is using NodeManager requires a few steps. All the configuration directives are located within the main sketch.

### MySensors configuration

Since NodeManager has to communicate with the MySensors network on your behalf, it has to know how to do it. On top of the main sketch you will find the typical MySensors directives you are used to which can be customized to configure the board to act as a MySensors node or a MySensors gateway. 
Please note you don't necessarily need a NodeManager gateway to interact with a NodeManager node. A NodeManager node is fully compatible with any existing gateway you are currently operating with.

### NodeManager configuration

NodeManager built-in capabilities can be enabled/disabled also when you need to save some storage for your code. 
To enable/disable a built-in feature:
* Install the required dependency if any
* Enable the corresponding capability by setting it to ON in the main sketch. To disable it, set it to OFF
* When a capability is enabled additional functions may be made available. Have a look at the API documentation for details

A list of the supported capabilities and the required dependencies is presented below:

### Add your sensors

NodeManager provides built-in implementation of a number of sensors through ad-hoc classes located within the "sensors" directory of the library. 
To use a built-in sensor:
* Install the required depedencies, if any (manually or through the Arduino IDE Library Manager)
* Include the sensor header file (e.g. `#include <sensors/SensorBattery.h>`)
* Create an instance of the sensor's class (e.g. `SensorBattery battery(node)`)

Once created, the sensor will automatically present one or more child to the gateway and controller.
A list of built-in sensors, required dependencies and the number of child automatically created is presented below:

Those sensors requiring a pin to operate would take it as an argument in the constructor. 
NodeManager automatically creates all the child_ids, assigning an incremental counter. If you need to set your own child_id, pass it as the last argument to the constructor

Examples:

~~~c
// Add a thermistor sensor attached to pin A0
#include <sensors/SensorThermistor.h>
SensorThermistor thermistor(A0);

// Add a LDR sensor attached to pin A0 and assing child_id 5
#include <sensors/SensorLDR.h>
SensorLDR ldr(A1,5);

// Add a temperature/humidity sensor SHT21 sensor. No pin required since using i2c
#include <sensors/SensorSHT21.h>
SensorSHT21 sht21;
~~~

The sensor will be then registered automatically with NodeManager which will take care of it all along its lifecycle. 
NodeManager will present each sensor for you to the controller, query each sensor and report the measure back to the gateway/controller. For actuators (e.g. relays) those can be triggered by sending a `REQ`/`SET` message with the expected type to their assigned child id.

### Configure your sensors

NodeManager and all the sensors can be configured from within `before()` in the main sketch. Find `Configure your sensors below` to customize the behavior of any sensor by calling one of the functions available.

Examples:

~~~c
// report measures of every attached sensors every 10 minutes
nodeManager.setReportIntervalMinutes(10);
// set the node to sleep in 5 minutes cycles
nodeManager.setSleepMinutes(5);
// report battery level every 10 minutes
battery.setReportIntervalMinutes(10);
// set an offset to -1 to a thermistor sensor
thermistor.setOffset(-1);
// Change the id of a the first child of a sht21 sensor
sht21.children.get(1)->child_id = 5;
// power all the nodes through dedicated pins
nodeManager.setPowerManager(power);
~~~

If not instructed differently, the node will stay awake and all the sensors will report every 10 minutes, battery level and signal level will be automatically reported every 60 minutes (if the corresponding sensors have been added). 

Please note, if you configure a sleep cycle, this may have an impact on the reporting interval since the sensor will be able to report its measures ONLY when awake. For example if you set a report interval of 5 minutes and a sleep cycle of 10 minutes, the sensors will report every 10 minutes.

## Running your code

Once finished configuring your node, upload your sketch to your arduino board as you are used to.

Check your gateway's logs to ensure the node is working as expected. You should see the node presenting itself, presenting all the registered sensors and reporting new measures at the configured reporting interval.
When `NODEMANAGER_DEBUG` is enabled, detailed information will be available through the serial port. The better understand the logs generaged by NodeManager, paste them into MySensors Log Parser (https://mysensors.org/build/parser).
Remember to disable debug once the tests have been completed to save additional storage.

## Communicate with the sensors

You can interact with each registered sensor by sending to the child id a `REQ` command (or a `SET` for output sensors like relays). For example to request the temperature to node_id 254 and child_id 1:

`254;1;2;0;0;`

To activate a relay connected to the same node, child_id 100 we need to send a `SET` command with payload set to 1:

`254;100;1;0;2;1`

No need to implement anything on your side since for built-in sensors this is handled automatically. 

## API

You can interact with each class provided by NodeManager through a set of API functions.

### OTA Configuration

When `NODEMANAGER_OTA_CONFIGURATION` is set to ON the API presented above can be also called remotely through `SensorConfiguration`, which is automatically added to NodeManager. SensorConfiguration exposes by default child id 200 that can be used to interact with the service by sending `V_CUSTOM` type of messages and commands within the payload. For each `REQ` message, the node will respond with a `SET` message if successful. 

Almost all the functions made available through the API can be called remotely. To do so, the payload must be in the format `<child_id>,<function_id>[,<value_to_set>]` where `child_id` is the recipient child id you want to communicate with (the node has child id 0), `function_id` is the number between square brackets you can find in the API documentation and, if the function takes and argument, this can be passed along in `value_to_set`. 
For example, to change the sleep time to e.g. 10 minutes:
~~~c
    // [4] set the duration (in minutes) of a sleep cycle
	void setSleepMinutes(unsigned long value);
~~~
`<node_id>;<configuration_child_id>;<req>;0;<V_CUSTOM>;<child_id>,<function_id>,<value>`
`100;200;2;0;48;0,4,10`

To wake up a node previously configured as sleeping, send the following as the node wakes up next:
~~~c
    // [9] wake up the board
    void wakeup();
~~~
`100;200;2;0;48;0,9`

if you want to collect and average 10 samples for the sensor on child_id 1:
~~~c
    // [5] For some sensors, the measurement can be queried multiple times and an average is returned (default: 1)
    void setSamples(unsigned int value);
~~~
`100;200;2;0;48;1,5,10`

If you want to decrease the temperature offset of a thermistor sensor to -2:
~~~c
    // [105] set a temperature offset
    void setOffset(float value);
~~~
`100;200;2;0;48;1,105,-2`

Please note that anything set remotely will NOT persist a reboot apart from the sleep interval which is saved to the EEPROM if setSaveSleepSettings() is set.

## How it works

A NodeManager object has to be created the beginning of your sketch and the interaction with your code happens through callback functions, placed at the end of `before()`, `presentation()`, `loop()`, `receive()` and `receiveTimes()`. The following is the flow through which the different functions are called:

`NodeManager::before()`:
* Setup the interrupt pins to wake up the board based on the configured interrupts
* Restore from the EEPROM the latest sleeping settings, if setSaveSleepSettings() was set
* Create and register an instance of SensorConfiguration

`NodeManager::presentation()`:
* Present the sketch
* Present each child of each of the registered sensors

`NodeManager::setup()`:
* Sync the time with the controller (if requested)
* Setup the SD card reader (if requested)
* Call `setup()` of each registered sensor
* Setup the interrupts as requested by the sensors

`Sensor::setup()`:
* Initialize the timers
* Call the sensor-specific implementation of setup by invoking `onSetup()`

`NodeManager::loop()`:
* Sync the time with the controller if not done recently 
* If all the sensors are powered by a pin, this is turned on
* Call `loop()` of each of the registered sensor
* If all the sensors are powered by a pin, this is turned off
* Go to sleep (if requested)

`Sensor::loop()`:
* If it is time for a new measure and if the sensor is powered by a pin, this is set to on
* For each registered sensor, the sensor-specific `onLoop()` is called. If multiple samples are requested, this is run multiple times. `onLoop()` is not intended to send out any message but just sets a new value to the requested child
* If the sensor is powered by a pin, this is turned off
* If it is time to report, a message is sent to the gateway with the value. Depending on the configuration, this is not sent if it is the same as the previous value or sent anyway after a given number of cycles. These functionalies are not sensor-specific and common to all the sensors inheriting from the `Sensor` class.

`NodeManager::receive()`:
* Receive a message from the radio network 
* Dispatch the message to the recipient sensor

`Sensor::receive()`: 
* Invoke `Sensor::loop()` which will execute the sensor main taks and eventually call `Sensor::onReceive()`

`Sensor::interrupt()`:
* Check if the value from the interrupt is matching the one expected
* Calls the sensor's implementation of `onInterrupt()` to handle the interrupt

Each sensor is in dedicated header file under the `sensors` directory of the library which has be directly included if needed into the main sketch. The implementation of the class is inline. Required libraries and OTA configuration request handling is everything happening inside the class. 

## Contributing

Contributes to NodeManager are of course more than welcome.
