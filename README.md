# NodeManager

NodeManager is intended to take care on your behalf of all those common tasks that a MySensors node has to accomplish, speeding up the development cycle of your projects. 
Consider it as a sort of frontend for your MySensors projects. When you need to add a sensor (which requires just uncommeting a single line),
NodeManager will take care of importing the required library, presenting the sensor to the gateway/controller, executing periodically the main function of the sensor 
(e.g. measure a temperature, detect a motion, etc.), allowing you to interact with the sensor and even configuring it remotely.

## Features

* Allows managing automatically the complexity behind battery-powered sensors spending most of their time sleeping
* Provides common functionalities to read and report the battery level
* For the most common sensors, provide embedded code so to allow their configuration with a single line
* Manage all the aspects of a sleeping cycle by leveraging smart sleep
* Allow configuring the node and any attached sensors remotely
* Allow waking up a sleeping node remotely at the end of a sleeping cycle
* Allow powering on each connected sensor only while the node is awake to save battery
* Report battery level periodically and automatically or on demand
* Calculate battery level without requiring an additional pin and the resistors
* Report signal level periodically and automatically or on demand
* Allow collecting and averaging multiple samples, tracking the last value and forcing periodic updates for any sensor
* Provide buil-in capabilities to handle interrupt-based sensors 

### Built-in sensors

NodeManager provides built-in implementation of a number of sensors through ad-hoc classes. 
To use a buil-in sensor:
* Install the required library if any
* Enable the corresponding module (uncomment it) in the main sketch
* Declare the sensor (uncomment it) in the main sketch

Once created, the sensor will automatically present one or more child to the gateway and controller.
A list of buil-in sensors, module to enable, required dependencies and the number of child automatically created is presented below:

### Built-in features

NodeManager built-in features can be enabled/disabled also when you need to save some storage for your code. 
To enable/disable a buil-in feature:
* Install the required library if any
* Enable the corresponding feature by setting it to ON in the main sketch. To disable it, set it to OFF
* When a feature is enabled additional functions may be made available. Have a look at the API documentation for details

## Installation

* Download the package or clone the git repository from https://github.com/mysensors/NodeManager
* Open the NodeManager.ino sketch and save it under a different name
* Configure you sensors and upload the sketch to your arduino board

Please note NodeManager cannot be used as an arduino library since requires access to your MySensors configuration directives, hence its files have to be placed into the same directory of your sketch.

### Installing the dependencies

Some of the sensors rely on third party libraries. Those libraries are not included within NodeManager and have to be installed from the Arduino IDE Library Manager (Sketch -> Include Library -> Manager Libraries) or manually. 
You need to install the library ONLY if you are planning to enable to use the sensor.

### Upgrade

* Download the latest version of NodeManager
* Replace the NodeManagerLibrary.ino and NodeManagerLibrary.h of your project with those just downloaded
* Review the release notes in case there is any manual change required to the main sketch

Please be aware when upgrading to v1.7 from an older version this procedure is not supported and must be manual.

## Configuration

Configuring a sketch with is using NodeManager requires a few steps. All the configuration directives are located within the main sketch.

### MySensors configuration

Since NodeManager has to communicate with the MySensors network on your behalf, it has to know how to do it. On top of the main sketch you will find the typical MySensors directives you are used to which can be customized to configure the board to act as a MySensors node or a MySensors gateway. 
Please note you don't necessarily need a NodeManager gateway to interact with a NodeManager node. A NodeManager node is fully compatible with any existing gateway you are currently operating with.

### NodeManager configuration

The next step is to enable NodeManager's modules required for your sensors. When a module is enabled, the required library will be loaded and the corresponding sensor will be made available. To enable it, uncomment the line. Enabled only what you need to ensure enough storage is left for your custom code.

### Add your sensors

Find in the main sketch `Add your sensors below` and add your sensors to NodeManager. To add a sensor, just create an instance of the class, passing it `node` as an argument. 
Those sensors requiring a pin to operate would take it as a second argument in the constructor. 
NodeManager automatically creates all the child_ids assigning an incremental counter. If you need to set your own child_id, pass it as the last argument to the constructor

~~~c
// Add a thermistor sensor attached to pin A0
SensorThermistor thermistor(node,A0);
// Add a LDR sensor attached to pin A0 and assing child_id 5
SensorLDR ldr(node,A1,5);
// Add a temperature/humidity sensor SHT21 sensor. No pin required since using i2c
SensorSHT21 sht21(node);
~~~

The sensor will be then registered automatically with NodeManager which will take care of it all along its lifecycle. Please ensure the corresponding module has been previously enabled for a successful compilation of the code.
NodeManager will present each sensor for you to the controller, query each sensor and report the measure back to the gateway/controller. For actuators (e.g. relays) those can be triggered by sending a `REQ` message with the expected type to their assigned child id.

### Configure your sensors

NodeManager and all the sensors can be configured from within `before()` in the main sketch. Find `Configure your sensors below` to customize the behavior of any sensor by calling one of the functions available.

~~~c
// report measures of every attached sensors every 10 minutes
node.setReportIntervalMinutes(10);
// set the node to sleep in 5 minutes cycles
node.setSleepMinutes(5);
// report battery level every 10 minutes
battery.setReportIntervalMinutes(10);
// set an offset to -1 to a thermistor sensor
thermistor.setOffset(-1);
// Change the id of a the first child of a sht21 sensor
sht21.children.get(1)->child_id = 5;
// power all the nodes through dedicated pins
node.setPowerManager(power);
~~~

If not instructed differently, the node will stay awake and all the sensors will report every 10 minutes, battery level and signal level will be automatically reported every 60 minutes (if the corresponding sensors have been added). 

Please note, if you configure a sleep cycle, this may have an impact on the reporting interval since the sensor will be able to report its measures ONLY when awake. For example if you set a report interval of 5 minutes and a sleep cycle of 10 minutes, the sensors will report every 10 minutes.

## Running your code

Once finished configuring your node, upload your sketch to your arduino board as you are used to.

Check your gateway's logs to ensure the node is working as expected. You should see the node presenting itself, presenting all the registered sensors and reporting new measures at the configured reporting interval.
When `FEATURE_DEBUG` is enabled, detailed information will be available through the serial port. Remember to disable debug once the tests have been completed to save additional storage.

## Communicate with the sensors

You can interact with each registered sensor by sending to the child id a `REQ` command (or a `SET` for output sensors like relays). For example to request the temperature to node_id 254 and child_id 1:

`254;1;2;0;0;`

To activate a relay connected to the same node, child_id 100 we need to send a `SET` command with payload set to 1:

`254;100;1;0;2;1`

No need to implement anything on your side since for built-in sensors this is handled automatically. 

## API

You can interact with each class provided by NodeManager through a set of API functions.

### Remote API

If SensorConfiguration is added to NodeManager, the API can be also called remotely. SensorConfiguration exposes child id 200 that can be used to interact with the service by sending `V_CUSTOM` type of messages and commands within the payload. For each `REQ` message, the node will respond with a `SET` message if successful. 

Almost all the functions made available through the API can be called remotely. To do so, the payload must be in the format `<child_id>,<function_id>[,<value_to_set>]` where `child_id` is the recipient child id you want to communicate with (the board has child id 0), `function_id` is the number between square brackets you can find in the API documentation and, if the function takes and argument, this can be passed along in `value_to_set`. 
For example, to change the sleep time to e.g. 10 minutes:
~~~c
    // [4] set the duration (in minutes) of a sleep cycle
    void setSleepMinutes(int value);
~~~
`<node_id>;<configuration_child_id>;<req>;0;<V_CUSTOM>;<child_id>,<function_id>,<value>`
`100;200;2;0;48;0,4,10`

To wake up a node previously configured as sleeping, send the following as the node wakes up next:
~~~c
    // [9] wake up the board
    void wakeup();
~~~
`100;200;2;0;48;0,9`

if you want to collect and average 10 samples for the sensor on child_id 1:
~~~c
    // [5] For some sensors, the measurement can be queried multiple times and an average is returned (default: 1)
    void setSamples(int value);
~~~
`100;200;2;0;48;1,5,10`

If you want to decrease the temperature offset of a thermistor sensor to -2:
~~~c
    // [105] set a temperature offset
    void setOffset(float value);
~~~
`100;200;2;0;48;1,105,-2`

Please note that anything set remotely will NOT persist a reboot apart from the sleep interval which is saved to the EEPROM if setSaveSleepSettings() is set.

## Creating a new sensor

### NodeManager's internal architecture review

A NodeManager object is created for you at the beginning of your sketch and its main functions must be called from within `before()`, `presentation()`, `loop()` and `receive()` to work properly. NodeManager will do the following during each phase:

NodeManager::before():
* Setup the interrupt pins to wake up the board based on the configured interrupts
* Restore from the EEPROM the latest sleeping settings, if setSaveSleepSettings() was set
* Call `before()` of each registered sensor

Sensor::before():
* Call sensor-specific implementation of before by invoking `onBefore()` to initialize the sensor. 

NodeManager::setup():
* Call `setup()` of each registered sensor

Sensor::setup():
* Call sensor-specific implementation of setup by invoking `onSetup()` to initialize the sensor

NodeManager::loop():
* If all the sensors are powered by an arduino pin, this is turned on
* Call `loop()` of each registered sensor
* If all the sensors are powered by an arduino pin, this is turned off

Sensor::loop():
* If the sensor is powered by an arduino pin, this is set to on
* For each registered sensor, the sensor-specific `onLoop()` is called. If multiple samples are requested, this is run multiple times. `onLoop()` is not intended to send out any message but just sets a new value to the requested child
* A message is sent to the gateway with the value. Depending on the configuration, this is not sent if it is the same as the previous value or sent anyway after a given number of cycles. These functionalies are not sensor-specific and common to all the sensors inheriting from the `Sensor` class.
* If the sensor is powered by an arduino pin, this is turned off

NodeManager::receive():
* Receive a message from the radio network 
* Dispatch the message to the recipient sensor

Sensor::receive(): 
* Invoke `Sensor::loop()` which will execute the sensor main taks and eventually call `Sensor::onReceive()`

Sensor::interrupt():
* Calls the sensor's implementation of `onInterrupt()` to handle the interrupt

### Custom sensors

If you want to create a new sensor, you can create a new class inheriting from Sensor or other subclasses. The constructor is supposed to assign to assign the sensor a name through the `_name` variable. The following methods have to be implemented:
~~~c
    // define what to do during before(). Usually creates all the Child(ren) which belong to the sensor
    void onBefore();
	// define what to do during setup(). Usually initialize the required libraries
    void onSetup();
    // define what to do during loop() by executing the sensor's main task. Usually does a calculation and store the value to send back to the given Child class.
    void onLoop(Child* child);
    // define what to do during receive() when the sensor receives a message
    void onReceive(MyMessage* message);
    // define what to do when receiving an interrupt
    void onInterrupt();
~~~

If the sensor implements a remote API, this has to be made available in SensorConfiguration::onReceive.

## Examples

* Analog Light and Temperature Sensor
The following sketch can be used to report the temperature and the light level based on a thermistor and LDR sensors attached to two analog pins of the arduino board (A1 and A2). Both the thermistor and the LDR are connected to ground on one side and to vcc via a resistor on the other so to measure the voltage drop across each of them through the analog pins.

The sensor will be put to sleep after startup and will report both the measures every 10 minutes. NodeManager will take care of presenting the sensors, managing the sleep cycle, reporting the battery level every hour and report the measures in the appropriate format. 

Even if the sensor is sleeping most of the time, it can be potentially woke up by sending a V_CUSTOM message to NodeManager service child id (200 by default) just after having reported its heartbeat. At this point the node will report awake and the user can interact with it by e.g. sending REQ messages to its child IDs, changing the duration of a sleep cycle, etc.

* Motion Sensor
The following sketch can be used to report back to the controller when a motion sensor attached to the board's pin 3 triggers. In this example, the board will be put to sleep just after startup and will report a heartbeat every hour. NodeManager will take care of configuring an interrupt associated to the provided pin so automatically wake up when a motion is detected and report a V_TRIPPED message back.

* Boiler Sensor

The following sketch controls a latching relay connected to a boiler. A latching relay (requiring only a pulse to switch) has been chosen to minimize the power consumption required by a traditional relay to stay on. This relay has normally two pins, one for closing and the other for opening the controlled circuit, connected to pin 6 (off) and 7 (on) of the arduino board. Since using a SensorLatchingRelay2Pins type of sensor, NodeManager will automatically consider the provided pin as the ON pin and the one just after as the OFF pin and will take care of just sending out a single pulse only when a SET command of type V_STATUS is sent to the child id. The appropriate pin will be then used.

In this example, the board also runs at 1Mhz so it can go down to 1.8V: by setting setBatteryMin() and setBatteryMax(), the battery percentage will be calculated and reported (by default, automatically every hour) based on these custom boundaries.

The board will be put to sleep just after startup and will report back to the controller every 5 minutes. It is the controller's responsability to catch when the board reports its heartbeat (using smart sleep behind the scene) and send a command back if needed.
