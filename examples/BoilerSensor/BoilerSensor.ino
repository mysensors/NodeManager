/**************************
Boiler Sensor

The following sketch controls a latching relay connected to a boiler. A latching relay (requiring only a pulse to switch) has been chosen to minimize the power consumption required by a traditional relay to stay on. This relay has normally two pins, one for closing and the other for opening the controlled circuit, connected to pin 6 (off) and 7 (on) of the arduino board. Since using a SensorLatchingRelay2Pins type of sensor, NodeManager will automatically consider the provided pin as the ON pin and the one just after as the OFF pin and will take care of just sending out a single pulse only when a SET command of type V_STATUS is sent to the child id. The appropriate pin will be then used.

In this example, the board also runs at 1Mhz so it can go down to 1.8V: by setting setMinVoltage() and setMaxVoltage(), the battery percentage will be calculated and reported (by default, automatically every hour) based on these custom boundaries.

The board will be put to sleep just after startup and will report back to the controller every 5 minutes. It is the controller's responsability to catch when the board reports its heartbeat (using smart sleep behind the scene) and send a command back if needed.
