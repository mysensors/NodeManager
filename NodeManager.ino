/*
NodeManager is intended to take care on your behalf of all those common tasks a MySensors node has to accomplish, speeding up the development cycle of your projects.
NodeManager includes the following main components:
- Sleep manager: allows managing automatically the complexity behind battery-powered sensors spending most of their time sleeping
- Power manager: allows powering on your sensors only while the node is awake
- Battery manager: provides common functionalities to read and report the battery level
- Remote configuration: allows configuring remotely the node without the need to have physical access to it
- Built-in personalities: for the most common sensors, provide embedded code so to allow their configuration with a single line
